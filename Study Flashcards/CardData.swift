    Card(id: <#T##UUID#>, subject: "Biology", question: "What is Prophase I", answer: "Each chromosome comes near its replicated chromosome pair. Nucleus dissolves at this stage. Crossing Over (exchange of genetic material) occurs at this phase."),
    
    Card(id: <#T##UUID#>, subject: "Biology", question: "What is Metaphase I", answer: "The pairs of homologous chromosomes line up in the center of the cell. The centromere of each chromatid pair attaches to one spindle fibre."),
    
    Card(id: <#T##UUID#>, subject: "Biology", question: "What is Anaphase I", answer: "Homologous chromosomes are pulled to opposite ends of the cell. Note that chromatids do not separate - each duplicated chromosome still has two chromatids."),
    
    Card(id: <#T##UUID#>, subject: "Biology", question: "What is Telophase I", answer: "The cytoplasm divides and two new cells form. Each new cell has one duplicated chromosome from each similar pair.")
